In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)
Service workers and graceful degradation are related in that service workers can embody the principles of graceful degradation when used. Service workers are a useful assisting tool for our web page, as their ability to manage caches and give our page offline capabilities can enhance the user experience. However, the application can still function even when service workers aren't supported. This embodies graceful degradation as we can build our page with full capabilities (with support for service workers and the benefits they bring), but we still ensure that the application functions normally on platforms that may not support the full range of technology used for our web page.
